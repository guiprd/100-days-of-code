# FIBONACCI SEQUENCE

## Implementations

### Day 1
* Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
* Elements' Definition: A(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-2), with A(0) = 1 and A(1) = 1
* Create an object that will store fibonacci sequence dynamically depending on the user input position.
* Create a method attached to the object that has the ability to return the element ordered, if exists in the sequence.
* Create a method attached to the object that has the ability to increment the sequence if the position given is greater than the length of the sequence.

### Day 2
* Improve filters on user input that will prevent the app to crash with a non int number is given.
* Implement the method FibonacciPartialSequence()
* Create init tests.
